    <h2>Track your daily progress real time</h2>
    <p>
      Given your free time, you can see how you’re using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      mprove it’s simple. It’s play & pause, so you can easily track your
      productivity and procrastination, even if things are offline,
      like gym or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Need to know how you’re doing as the day passes by? Simply look up to your
      status bar and see how you already used your precious time in percentage.
      Forget that stopwatch and math at the end of the day. Real time, baby.
